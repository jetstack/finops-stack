[Visit finops-stack.jetstack.io](https://finops-stack.jetstack.io) for the full site and comprehensive details.

## Overview

The FinOps Stack is the blueprint for a solution to automate FinOps best practices. It integrates a suite of open-source tools into a unified, easy-to-install platform.

Our goal is to empower organisations with the tools they need to manage, visualise, and optimise their cloud resources in complex, ever-changing environments.

The FinOps Stack is designed to work out-of-the-box seamlessly with GKE standard/autopilot clusters using Google Managed Prometheus, and can be customised for an organisationâ€™s business requirements and/or Kubernetes distribution.

This repository contains the core components of FinOps Stack, including:

- **Static Site**: The source code for the FinOps Stack website, providing documentation, guides, and resources for users.
- **Helm Charts** (`charts` directory): Helm charts included as part of the FinOps Stack. Charts are included in this directory so they can be used as blueprints and customised/extended where required.
- **Installation**: Configuration and documentation for installing the FinOps Stack.

## Installation and Usage

For ease of use, the FinOps Stack is installed using a single Helmfile command. For detailed installation instructions, review the README under the `/installation` directory of this repository.
